## Makefiles
*Explain what is a Makefile and its role in the RR workflow.*  

A Makefile is a file with commands used in the terminal. It also links files and directories together and describes the way they interact. It's extremely useful when a certain source file is modified because the linking in makefiles allow for updates.

## Git
*Explain what is Git, and its role in the RR workflow.*  

Git is a version control system. It allows for snapshots and merged versions of your project. Along with Github, it allows for collaborative and sharable data because it takes into account of multiple timelines and users and allows for online sharing. It's especially useful when you have multiple authors working on the same project and everyone is working at a different pace. It will combine all the edits effectively without the users worrying about overlaps or undue deletions.
