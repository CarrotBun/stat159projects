### Project Narrative
**Write a narrative about how you worked on this project.**  
Before I started, I observed the structure of the file organization in the instructions. I then created a new directory in my stat159 local folder, named "projects" to contain all my current and future projects.  
  
I created a new directory "project01" to contain this particular project. Once inside project01, I initiated Git and added a .gitignore file. I also made a Makefile to create some of the subdirectories. It was especially useful for the sections of the paper. On Github, I created a new repository for this project and connected the two. I added my .DS_Store file to my .gitignore because it's just Mac's file ordering information and irrelevant to Github. Whenever I had changes in my files, I would add and commit them. Then I would push them to update my Github backup. 

### Project Resources
Besides the resources mentioned here (makefiles, git, pandoc, markdown), I obtained help from help pages of Github and Makefiles.
